      <h2>From Star Fox to Code Baker: The Odyssey of Bread Pitt</h2>
      <p>Bread was a kid of the 90s, back when the Super Nintendo was all the rage and Saturday mornings were defined by cereal bowls bigger than a horse trough. He lived in a cozy town, not particularly known for anything, but that hardly mattered to Bread. He lived for two things: computers and <a href="https://youtu.be/lvFI-ZF6jVU?si=eI_htKtwc8zSOK-p" target="_blank">Star Fox</a>.</p>

      <p>He’d wake up before dawn—okay, maybe he just thought it was dawn but was actually 7 AM—and spend hours glued to his SNES, exploring the Lylat System with Fox McCloud and friends. He loved the idea of soaring through space, barrel-rolling past laser fire. But while he loved Star Fox, the honest truth was that flight freaked him out. The mere thought of real turbulence got his heart thumping in all the worst ways.</p>
    
      <p>In school, Bread was the quiet kid tucked away in the computer lab whenever he could sneak in. While classmates shot paper wads at each other, he tinkered with archaic machines that spat out cryptic DOS commands. He’d swap 3.5-inch floppies, try to push them in upside down at first, panic, and then (after a bit of fumbling) figure out the right way. Every time he typed a line of code in QBasic and watched something happen on screen—be it a shape or a silly message—it felt like magic.</p>
    
      <p>But Bread had an ambition: he wanted to join the Corneria defense force. Of course, that was more of a starry-eyed dream than any real plan—courtesy of all those hours playing Star Fox. He’d fantasize about being the next hotshot pilot, twisting and turning in an Arwing like it was second nature. He even tried out for the forces, but as soon as the flight simulator began shaking like a rickety washing machine, his knuckles turned white, and he felt more like he was about to hurl than become a hero.</p>
    
      <p>Turns out flight anxiety is a deal-breaker when you’re trying to navigate the cosmos. He flunked the test and was kindly shown the door. Crushed, he had to figure out a new path.</p>
    
      <p>Fortunately, Bread discovered that applying his fascination for computers and coding could give him that same sense of adventure—minus the panic attack at 10,000 feet. He joined an apprenticeship, learning to code day in, day out. Even when the other apprentices took breaks, Bread stuck around to tinker, hungry to build something that would set the world on fire (in a good way). He joked that he was “baking code” from scratch, mixing logic and syntax like dough and yeast. The nickname “Code Baker” stuck.</p>
    
      <p>Eventually, Bread created small games inspired by Star Fox, though on a way smaller scale: think pixelated ships and blocky asteroids. But to him, those were his personal starfields. Each game was another chance to explore the digital frontier, to push himself. And when he saw folks playing his little space shooters, you could see that same spark in their eyes that he got whenever he booted up Star Fox.</p>
    
      <p>So while Corneria’s defense force never pinned pilot wings on his chest, Bread found that his true calling was in building worlds of his own, one line of code at a time. He didn’t get to fly an Arwing in real life, but the digital universe he created was just as exciting—and a lot less sweaty for him.</p>
    
      <p>Today, Bread still fires up his ancient SNES when he needs a nostalgia boost. He’ll grab that old controller and blast a few space baddies, remembering how it all began. Then he’ll turn back to his latest coding project with a grin, ready to whisk up another batch of code for players everywhere to enjoy—proudly bearing the title of Code Baker, and loving every minute of it.</p>
